		<h1>Painting with Watercolors</h1>
		<h2>Washing Techniques:</h2>
			<p> Wet washing, dry washing, and back washing are a few examples</p> 
		<h2>Washed Inked:</h2>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.johnlovett.com/watercolor-techniques">
		Waterproof ink is applied, allowed to almost dry, then scrubbed off. This will produce interesting textures and shapes.
		The results are unpredictable and permanent, so this technique is best used before watercolor washes are added. Best
		results are obtained using a spray bottle of water and rough bristle brush to scrub the ink back.
